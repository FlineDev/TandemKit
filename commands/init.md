# HarnessKit — Project Initialization

This command sets up HarnessKit in the current project. Run it once per project.

## Important UX Rules

Follow these rules throughout the entire init flow:

1. **Do NOT explain what HarnessKit is.** The user already knows — they just ran the init command.
2. **Ask questions ONE AT A TIME.** Before each question, write 2-3 sentences of context in chat explaining WHY this matters and what you recommend. Then ask using AskUserQuestion. Never batch multiple questions into one call.
3. **Do NOT install or configure anything without explicit user approval.** Ask first, show what you want to do, get a "yes", then do it.
4. **Before modifying any existing file** (.gitignore, settings.json, config.toml), explain what you want to change and get user approval.
5. **When recommending external tools**, always provide: verified GitHub URL, star count, brief description of what it does, and at least one alternative. Never present a single option as the only choice.
6. **For npm packages, use `npx -y`** (run without global install), never `npm install -g`. Check the user's permission deny list in settings.json — never recommend commands that appear there.
7. **MCP server configurations go in `.mcp.json`** at the project root, NOT in `.claude/settings.json`. MCP tool permissions (allow rules) go in settings.json.
8. **Start brief.** Jump straight to investigation. No preamble, no tutorial.

## Pre-Flight Check

1. Verify `HarnessKit/` does not already exist in the project root. If it does, tell the user: "HarnessKit is already initialized in this project. Config is at HarnessKit/Config.json."
2. Check that this is a git repository. If not, warn: "This project is not a git repository. HarnessKit works best with git for feature branches and milestone commits. Continue anyway?"

## Step 1 — Install watchman

HarnessKit uses `watchman-wait` for near-instant file change detection between sessions.

Check if watchman is installed:
```bash
which watchman-wait
```

If not installed, tell the user:
> "HarnessKit needs `watchman` for file change detection between sessions. Install with: `brew install watchman` (macOS). Want me to install it?"

Wait for approval before installing.

## Step 2 — Investigate the Project

Before asking questions, investigate the project thoroughly to make informed recommendations. Tell the user: "Let me investigate your project..." then do all of the following silently:

1. **Read project documentation:**
   - `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` — conventions, architecture, commit rules
   - `README.md` — project overview

2. **Detect project type — check for ALL build systems:**
   - `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` → Apple platform app
   - `Package.swift` → Swift package (can coexist with .xcodeproj!)
   - `package.json` → Node.js / web
   - `Cargo.toml` → Rust
   - `go.mod` → Go
   - **Check submodules:** Read `.gitmodules` if it exists. Check inside submodule directories for build files too — the main project files may be in a submodule (e.g., `App/Package.swift`, `App/MyApp.xcodeproj`).
   - **If both Package.swift AND .xcodeproj exist:** Note both. `swift build`/`swift test` may be simpler for evaluation, but `xcodebuild` may be needed for full app features. Present both options to the user.

3. **Check available tools:**
   - Read `~/.claude/settings.json` for global permissions and MCP tool allowances
   - Read project `.claude/settings.json` and `.mcp.json` for project-level MCP servers
   - Check what's already available: Xcode MCP? Playwright? Simulator tools?

4. **Read commit conventions:**
   - Check AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for commit message rules, push policies, branch conventions
   - Check for git hooks

5. **Read the user's permission deny list** in settings.json — note any denied commands so you don't recommend them later.

Present a brief summary of findings to the user before asking the first question.

## Step 3 — Ask Configuration Questions

Ask each question ONE AT A TIME. Before each question, explain briefly in chat why it matters and what you recommend.

### Question 1: Project Type Confirmation

Present your detection results, then ask:

> "I found [what you found]. Does this look right?"

If the project has both Package.swift and .xcodeproj, mention both and ask which build path the user prefers for evaluation.

### Question 2: Evaluation Scope

Explain that HarnessKit's evaluator can verify different aspects depending on the tools available, then ask:

> "What should the Evaluator verify?"

Options:
- Code correctness (build + tests) — always included
- UI verification (screenshots, interaction) — recommended for apps
- Accessibility — recommended for apps
- Performance — if relevant
- Domain-specific verification — for expert systems

### Question 3: Tool Setup (Based on Project Type)

**For Apple platform projects:**

Read `references/Evaluation-Strategy-ApplePlatform.md` for full details. Present available options with GitHub links and star counts:

1. **Xcode MCP** (built into Xcode) — builds, tests, SwiftUI preview screenshots. [Already available / Not connected]
2. **Simulator interaction** — present the options from the reference file with verified GitHub URLs and star counts. Let the user choose.
3. **AppleScript** — for running/stopping the app from Xcode. No install needed.

**Do NOT start installing prerequisites or checking dependencies until the user has explicitly agreed to install a specific tool.**

If the user agrees to install a tool, guide them step by step:
- Show the exact commands they need to run (using `!` prefix for interactive commands)
- Create the `.mcp.json` file with the correct configuration
- Add the MCP tool permission to `.claude/settings.json` (e.g., `mcp__mobile-mcp__*`)

**For web projects:**

Read `references/Evaluation-Strategy-Web.md`. Present Playwright MCP option with setup status.

**For CLI/library projects:**

Read `references/Evaluation-Strategy-CLI.md`. Confirm the test command that will be used.

**For domain systems:**

Read `references/Evaluation-Strategy-Domain.md`. Ask about canonical test cases.

### Question 4: Git Commit Policy

Present what you found in the project's commit conventions, then ask:

> "For HarnessKit missions:"

1. Should the Generator make commits automatically at milestones? (default: yes)
2. Should each mission use a feature branch? (default: yes)
3. Branch name prefix? (e.g., `feature/` → `feature/001-jwt-auth`, or empty for `001-jwt-auth`)

### Question 5: Codex Compatibility

> "Do you want to use Codex for evaluation or planning? If yes, I'll create a symlink so the HarnessKit skill is available in Codex sessions too."

### Question 6: .gitignore Preference

> "During active missions, HarnessKit creates coordination files (State.json, Generator/, Evaluator/ round reports). Do you want these gitignored during active missions? If yes, they'll be force-added at mission completion for archival. If no, you'll see them in your Git UI but need to be careful not to stage them during milestone commits."

## Step 4 — Check Permissions for Autonomous Operation

**Detection-based:** Only speak up about what's actually missing. If permissions are already broad, say nothing.

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` and project `.claude/settings.json`. Check for:
- Core tools: `Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`
- MCP tools for the configured evaluation tools (e.g., `mcp__xcode__*`, `mcp__mobile-mcp__*`)

If missing critical permissions, explain what's needed and why.

If Codex is enabled, check `~/.codex/config.toml` for sandbox mode and approval policy. Only mention issues if the config is too restrictive for autonomous operation.

## Step 5 — Create the HarnessKit Directory

Create the folder structure:

```
HarnessKit/
├── Config.json
├── Planner.md
├── Generator.md
└── Evaluator.md
```

### Config.json

```json
{
  "currentMission": null,
  "nextMissionNumber": 1,
  "projectType": "[detected/confirmed type]",
  "git": {
    "autoCommit": true,
    "featureBranches": true,
    "branchPrefix": "",
    "commitConventions": "[from project docs]"
  },
  "evaluation": {
    "scope": ["code", "ui", "accessibility"],
    "tools": ["xcode-mcp", "mobile-mcp", "applescript"]
  }
}
```

### Planner.md, Generator.md, Evaluator.md

Populate each with project-specific context based on your investigation findings and the user's answers. Use the appropriate Evaluation-Strategy reference as a template for the Evaluator.md.

## Step 6 — Update .gitignore (If User Agreed)

Only if the user said yes in Question 6. Add the entries they approved.

If the user said no, skip this step entirely.

## Step 7 — Create Codex Symlink (If Requested)

If the user wants Codex compatibility:

First, detect if the plugin was loaded via marketplace (cache) or `--plugin-dir` (development):

```bash
# Check if marketplace cache exists
CACHE_PATH=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path '*/harness-kit/skills/harness-kit' -type d 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
```

- If `CACHE_PATH` is found: use it for the symlink
- If not found (--plugin-dir mode): ask the user for the plugin path, or detect it from the current session

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
ln -sf "<resolved-path>" .agents/skills/harness-kit
```

Add `.agents/skills/harness-kit` to `.gitignore` (this symlink is machine-specific and should not be committed). Document the symlink setup command in `AGENTS.md` so collaborators can recreate it.

If Codex MCP servers need configuring, update `~/.codex/config.toml` with the appropriate MCP server entries and auto-approval rules.

## Step 8 — Summary

Present a brief summary table of what was set up, then end with a clear call to action:

> **Next step:** To start your first mission, just say:
> `Let's use HarnessKit to [your goal]`
