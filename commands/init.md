# HarnessKit — Project Initialization

This command sets up HarnessKit in the current project. Run it once per project.

## Important UX Rules

Follow these rules throughout the entire init flow:

1. **Do NOT explain what HarnessKit is.** The user already knows — they just ran the init command.
2. **Ask questions ONE AT A TIME.** Before each question, write 2-3 sentences of context in chat explaining WHY this matters and what you recommend. Then ask using AskUserQuestion. Never batch multiple questions.
3. **Do NOT install or configure anything without explicit user approval.** Ask first, show what you want to do, get a "yes", then do it.
4. **Before modifying any existing file** (.gitignore, settings.json, config.toml), explain what you want to change and get user approval.
5. **When recommending external tools**, always provide: verified GitHub URL, star count, brief description of what it does, and at least one alternative. Never present a single option as the only choice.
6. **For npm packages, use `npx -y`** (run without global install), never `npm install -g`. Check the user's permission deny list in settings.json — never recommend commands that appear there.
7. **MCP server configurations go in `.mcp.json`** at the project root, NOT in `.claude/settings.json`. MCP tool permissions (allow rules) go in settings.json.
8. **Start brief.** Jump straight to investigation. No preamble, no tutorial.
9. **Before writing any files, show a recap** of all the settings you're about to encode and get user confirmation. This catches misunderstandings before they're baked into config files.

## Pre-Flight Check

1. Verify `HarnessKit/` does not already exist in the project root. If it does, tell the user: "HarnessKit is already initialized in this project. Config is at HarnessKit/Config.json."
2. Check that this is a git repository. If not, warn: "This project is not a git repository. HarnessKit works best with git for feature branches and milestone commits. Continue anyway?"

## Step 1 — Install watchman

Check if watchman is installed: `which watchman-wait`

If not installed, tell the user and wait for approval before installing.

## Step 2 — Investigate the Project

Before asking questions, investigate thoroughly. Tell the user: "Let me investigate your project..." then do all of the following:

1. **Read project documentation:**
   - `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` — conventions, architecture, commit rules
   - `README.md` — project overview

2. **Detect project type — check for ALL build systems:**
   - `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` → Apple platform app
   - `Package.swift` → Swift package (can coexist with .xcodeproj!)
   - `package.json` → Node.js / web
   - `Cargo.toml` → Rust / `go.mod` → Go
   - **Check submodules:** Read `.gitmodules` if it exists. Check inside submodule directories for build files.
   - **If both Package.swift AND .xcodeproj exist:** Note both and present options.

3. **Check available tools:**
   - Read `~/.claude/settings.json` for global permissions and MCP tool allowances
   - Read project `.claude/settings.json` and `.mcp.json` for project-level MCP servers
   - Check what's already available: Xcode MCP? Playwright? Simulator tools?

4. **Read commit conventions and branch patterns:**
   - Check AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for commit message rules, push policies, branch conventions
   - Run `git branch -a` to see existing branch naming patterns — use these for HarnessKit feature branches. Do NOT invent a new convention or add prefixes.
   - Check for git hooks

5. **Read the user's permission deny list** in settings.json.

6. **Discover existing skills:**
   - List `.claude/skills/` contents. Read the name + description of each existing skill.
   - Note which skills are relevant for the Generator (e.g., code context, review skills) and Evaluator (e.g., preview patterns, testing approaches).
   - Reference these in the role files so roles know to load them.

7. **Explore documentation structure beyond AGENTS.md:**
   - Check for research folders, exploration docs, context directories, domain-specific reference material.
   - If found, note them for the Planner.md — the Planner needs to know ALL knowledge sources, not just code docs.

8. **Check Codex permissions** (if `~/.codex/config.toml` exists):
   - Check if bash/shell commands are allowed (sandbox_mode, approval_policy)
   - This determines whether Codex should use CLI or MCP mode for tools

Present a brief summary of findings to the user before asking the first question.

## Step 3 — Ask Configuration Questions

Ask each question ONE AT A TIME. Before each question, explain briefly in chat why it matters and what you recommend.

### Question 1: Project Type Confirmation

Present your detection results, then ask.

### Question 2: Evaluation Scope

Explain that HarnessKit's evaluator can verify different aspects, then ask:

> "What should the Evaluator verify?"

Options:
- Code correctness (build + tests) — always included for code missions
- UI verification (previews, screenshots, interaction) — recommended for apps
- Domain/content verification (verify claims against source material) — for documentation, skill files, knowledge bases
- Accessibility — recommended for apps
- Performance — if relevant

**Domain/content verification must be a first-class option.** Not every mission produces code. Documentation missions, skill file creation, and knowledge base work need source verification as the primary evaluation path.

### Question 3: Tool Setup (Based on Project Type)

**For Apple platform projects:**

Read `references/Evaluation-Strategy-ApplePlatform.md` for full details. Recommend XcodeBuildMCP CLI as the primary tool for BOTH Claude and Codex sessions (if both allow bash/shell commands). Only suggest MCP mode if the user's Codex config restricts bash.

Install XcodeBuildMCP if the user agrees:
```bash
brew tap getsentry/xcodebuildmcp
brew install xcodebuildmcp
xcodebuildmcp init
```

**For web/CLI/domain projects:** Read the appropriate Evaluation-Strategy reference.

### Question 4: Git Commit Policy

Present what you found in the project's commit conventions and branch patterns, then ask:

> "For HarnessKit missions:"

1. Should the Generator make commits automatically at milestones? (default: yes)
2. Should each mission use a feature branch? (default: yes)

**Branch naming:** Show the pattern you detected from existing branches (e.g., "Your branches follow `jeehut/feature-description`"). HarnessKit will use the same pattern. Do NOT invent a new convention or add prefixes like "hk-".

**If submodules exist:** Ask specifically about commit scope:
- "Should auto-commits happen in the umbrella repo, in submodules, or submodules only?"
- "Should auto-commits ever happen on the main branch, or only on feature branches?"

### Question 5: Codex Compatibility

> "Do you want to use Codex for evaluation or planning?"

If yes, note for symlink creation. Default to CLI mode for Codex (same as Claude) if bash is allowed in Codex config.

### Question 6: .gitignore Preference

> "Do you want HarnessKit coordination files gitignored during active missions?"

## Step 4 — Check Permissions for Autonomous Operation

**Detection-based:** Only speak up about what's actually missing.

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` and project `.claude/settings.json`. Check for core tools and MCP tools.

If Codex is enabled, check `~/.codex/config.toml`. Only mention issues if restrictive.

## Step 5 — Recap and Confirm

**Before writing any files**, present a summary of everything you're about to encode:

> "Here's what I'll set up:
> - Project type: [type]
> - Evaluation scope: [list]
> - Tools: [list]
> - Git: auto-commit [yes/no], scope [where], feature branches [yes/no], branch pattern [pattern]
> - Codex: [enabled/disabled], mode [CLI/MCP]
> - .gitignore: [yes/no]
>
> Does this look right?"

Wait for confirmation. This catches misunderstandings before they're baked into config files.

## Step 6 — Create the HarnessKit Directory

Create the folder structure with Config.json, Planner.md, Generator.md, Evaluator.md, and ClaudeEvaluatorPrompt.md.

### ClaudeEvaluatorPrompt.md

Copy from the plugin's `system-prompts/claude-evaluator.md` template. **If the file already exists** (re-init): do NOT overwrite. Ask first.

This file is NOT modified by the self-learning system — keep it stable.

### Config.json

```json
{
  "currentMission": null,
  "nextMissionNumber": 1,
  "projectType": "[detected/confirmed type]",
  "git": {
    "autoCommit": true,
    "autoCommitUmbrellaRepo": false,
    "autoCommitOnMainBranch": false,
    "featureBranches": true,
    "branchPattern": "[detected from existing branches]",
    "commitConventions": "[from project docs]"
  },
  "evaluation": {
    "scope": ["code", "ui-previews", "domain-content"],
    "tools": ["xcodebuildmcp-cli", "xcode-mcp"]
  }
}
```

### Planner.md, Generator.md, Evaluator.md

Populate each with project-specific context. Key requirements:

**Evaluator.md must cover BOTH code missions AND documentation/content missions:**
- Build/test/preview commands (for code missions)
- Source verification guidance (for documentation/content missions)
- "Always Do" and "Never Do" sections should distinguish between code and content missions
- For macOS apps: SwiftUI views → `#Preview` + `RenderPreview` as primary UI verification. AppKit/integrated flows → manual testing. `screencapture` → evidence capture only (not automated navigation).

**Generator.md should reference existing project skills** that are relevant (e.g., "Load `swift-code-context` before writing Swift code", "Load `swiftui-code-context` for SwiftUI work", "Use `review-swift-changes` for validation").

**Planner.md should reference ALL major documentation areas** — not just code docs. Include research folders, exploration docs, context directories, domain-specific reference material with "When to read" guidance.

### Verify Build Commands

Run the build command once to verify it works. Fix if needed.

## Step 7 — Update .gitignore (If User Agreed)

Only if the user said yes in Question 6.

## Step 8 — Create Codex Symlink (If Requested)

Default to CLI mode for Codex (same as Claude) if bash is allowed. Only set up MCP server in `config.toml` if the user explicitly prefers MCP or if bash is restricted.

Add `.agents/skills/mission` to `.gitignore`.

## Step 9 — Update AGENTS.md (Safety Net)

Add a brief HarnessKit section to the project's `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` if that's what the project uses). This serves as a safety net — even if the plugin isn't loaded, Claude will know HarnessKit exists and what to do:

```markdown
## HarnessKit

This project uses HarnessKit for multi-session Planner/Generator/Evaluator coordination. When a user mentions HarnessKit or starts a mission, load the `harness-kit:mission` skill. If the skill is not available, tell the user to install the plugin or restart with `--plugin-dir /path/to/HarnessKit`.

Project-specific role files: `HarnessKit/Planner.md`, `HarnessKit/Generator.md`, `HarnessKit/Evaluator.md`.
```

Keep it brief — one short paragraph. Ask the user before editing AGENTS.md.

## Step 10 — Summary

Present a brief summary table of what was set up, then end with:

> **Next step:** To start your first mission, just say:
> `Let's use HarnessKit to [your goal]`
